## Technologies
* Python 3
* Matplotlib
* PySide2

## Features
List of features ready and TODOs for future development
* Technical application for quickly drawing functions
* Drawing 2D charts with the range and step entered by the user
* Ability to save charts in many formats
* Tooltips and simple communication window


To-do list:
- [ ] solve problem with drawing rational functions incorrectly for small step (less than 0.5)

Possible improvements:
- [ ] various functions on the same plot
- [ ] support for 3D graphs

## Status
Project is: _in progress_
